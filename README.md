#  Image Retrieval for Vehicle Re-Identification using VeRi Dataset
This project aims to develop an image retrieval system for vehicle re-identification using the VeRi dataset. The goal is to generate embedding representations for images, enabling effective matching between query vehicles (anchors) and both positive matches (same vehicle) and negative matches (different vehicles).

To achieve this, we use a pre-trained ResNet model for feature extraction, mapping images into a lower-dimensional embedding space where similar vehicles are positioned closer together.
